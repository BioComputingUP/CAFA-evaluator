# CAFA-evaluator

This program calculates F-score, weighted F-score and S-score as well as precision-recall and 
remaining uncertaintyâ€“misinformation curves as described in the 
[Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation (CAFA)](https://www.biofunctionprediction.org/cafa/).

CAFA-evaluator is generic and works with any type of ontology. Its implementation is inspired to the 
original Matlab code used in CAFA2 assessment and available at 
[https://github.com/yuxjiang/CAFA2](https://github.com/yuxjiang/CAFA2)

#### CAFA5 challenge
In the Kaggle CAFA5 challenge the software is executed with the following command:

    python3 main.py go-basic.obo predition_dir/ test_terms.tsv -out_dir results/ -ia IA.txt -prop fill -norm cafa -th_step 0.001 -max_terms 500

In the example above the method prediction file should be inside the `prediction_dir/` folder and 
evaluated against the `test_terms.tsv` file containing the ground truth (not available to participants).

## Installation

The software does not require any installation. Simply download the repository and run the **main.py** script. 
The following packages are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib (only for generating the plots)

## Algorithm information 

#### Notes
* The word `aspect`, `namespeace` and `sub-ontology` are used interchangeably in the following documentation.
* In order to replicate CAFA results, you can simply adapt the input files. 
  - *No/partial knowledge* can be reproduced by filtering/splitting the **ground truth file** 
  - In order to exclude specific terms from the analyses, 
e.g. generic "binding" terms, you can directly modify the input **ontology file** 

#### Input filtering

Prediction files are filtered considering only those targets included in the ground truth and 
only those terms included in the ontology file. 
If the ground truth contains only annotations from one aspect (e.g. "molecular function"), 
the evaluation is provided only for that aspect.
The `-max_terms` parameter determines the maximum number of terms that will be considered for each target. 
Parsing stops when the target limit for every ontology is reached. The score is not checked, 
meaning that terms are not sorted before the check, and the check is performed before propagation.

The ontology is processed with an internal parser that accepts only the OBO format. 
The following rules are applied: 
  - Obsolete terms are always excluded
  - Only "is_a" and "part_of" relationships are considered
  - Cross-aspect or cross-ontology relationships are always discarded
  - Alternative term IDs are automatically mapped to the main ID

When information accretion is provided, terms which are not available in the accretion file are 
removed from the ontology.

#### Terms propagation

Both the predictions and the ground truth annotations are always propagated up to the ontology root(s). 
Two strategies are available: i) prediction scores are propagated without overwriting the scores 
assigned to the parents; ii) scores are propagated considering always the max.

#### Memory usage

- The algorithm stores in memory a Numpy boolean *N x M* array 
(N = number of ground truth targets; M = ontology terms of a single aspect)
for each aspect in the ground truth file.

- An array of the same size (rows &le; N), but containing floats (the prediction scores) instead of booleans, 
is stored for each prediction file. Prediction files are processed one by one and the matrix gets reassigned.



## Assessment

The assessment is provided by running the **main.py** script. While the plots are generated running 
the **plot.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook. To run the assessment:

    python3 main.py ontology.obo predition_dir/ ground_truth_dir/ground_truth.txt -out_dir results/ -ia ia.txt
    
**Mandatory positional arguments**
* *Ontology file* - Ontology in OBO format

* *Prediction folder* - Contain prediction files. Optionally, files can be organized into sub-folders, e.g. one folder per team. 
Sub-folders are processed recursively and the sub-folder name is used as prefix for the method name

* *Ground truth file* - The ground truth file must contain terms in any of the ontology namespace

**Optional arguments (non positional)**

* *-out_dir* - Output folder. Default to current folder
* *-ia* - Information accretion file
* *-prop* - Propagation strategy 
* *-no_orphans* - Exclude orphan terms, e.g. the root(s)
* *-norm* - Normalization strategy

**info.log** - Log file. Information is appended


## Plots

Plots are generated by running all the cells in the **plot.ipynb** Jupyter Notebook after generating the assessment
dataframe **evaluation_all.tsv** (see above). 

### Input

In order to generate the figures you need to manually modify the first cell of the notebook which 
contains information about the input path and a few parameters. Parameters include: 
* the metric (F-score, wighted F-score, S measure)
* the path to the input dataframe (*evaluation_all.tsv*)
* the output folder
* an optional file (*names.tsv*) including information about methods aliases and groups. If provided, the results
are presented selecting only one method per group. Example file:
```
filename	group	label
INGA_1.cafa	INGA	INGA_1
INGA_2.cafa	INGA	INGA_2
```

### Output

**fig_< metric >_< name_space >.png** - A notebook that generates a figure for each namespace in the dataframe and the selected metric. 
The notebook generates one metric at the time, you have to modify the input cell to generate the plots for a different metric

**fig_< metric >.tsv** - A file with the data points for the metric curves. One curve for each method
